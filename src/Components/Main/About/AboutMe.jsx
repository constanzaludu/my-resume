        <h2>About me</h2>  
        <br/>
        <h5>Who am I?</h5>
        <p>
          My name is Constanza Luduena. I consider myself a very curious person
          who is always happy to face new challenges. I am a
          technical-scientifical and literary English-Spanish translator and a
          full stack developer.
        </p>
        <h5>Why me?</h5>
        <p>
          I am a very curious, communicative and detail-oriented person who is
          always willing to learn and make the most of every experience. My
          greatest strengths are my team-work and problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <h5>My academic life and professional career</h5>
        <p>
          I am a very passionate person who can never get enough of learning. In
          2012 I started my translation studies at Lenguas Vivas Spangenberg, a
          highly recognized college situated in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Some
          years went by and I decided to plunge into the world of simultaneous
          and consecutive conference interpretation, which helped me consolidate
          my linguistic and communicative foundations. The icing on the
          cake was having the great honor of interpreting Barry Rassin, the then
          President of Rotary International, during his official visit to
          Argentina. In 2018 I graduated as Technical-Scientifical and Literary
          English-Spanish translator.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, I decided to broaden my horizons and embark on a journey I
          had been very keen on for quite a while: <strong>Full Stack development</strong> at
          Numen Academy. An appropiate decision I am delighted about.
