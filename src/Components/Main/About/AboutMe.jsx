        <h5>Who am I?</h5>
        <p>
          My name is Constanza Luduena. I consider myself a very curious person
          who is always happy to face new challenges. I am a
          technical-scientifical and literary English-Spanish translator and a
          full stack developer.
        </p>
        <h5>Why me?</h5>
        <p>
          I am a very curious, communicative and detail-oriented person who is
          always willing to learn and make the most of every experience. My
          greatest strengths are my team-work and problem-solving skills.{" "}

        <h5>My academic life and professional career</h5>
        <p>
          I am a very passionate person who can never get enough of learning. In
          2012 I started my translation studies at Lenguas Vivas Spangenberg, a
          highly recognized college situated in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Some
          years went by and I decided to plunge into the world of simultaneous
          and consecutive conference interpretation, which help me consolidate
          the linguistic and communicative basis I already had. The icing on the
          cake was having the great honor of interpreting Barry Rassin, the then
          President of Rotary International, during his official visit to
          Argentina. In 2018 I graduated as Technical-Scientifical and Literary
          English-Spanish translator and, since I was already working as a
          teacher of English as a second language and freelance translator, I
          had the opportunity of taking part in an exchange program called RITE,
          aimed at young English teachers in Kansas, USA.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, I decided to broaden my horizons and embark on a journey I
          had been very keen on for quite a while: <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Full Stack development</span> at
          Numen Academy. An appropiate decision I am delighted about.{" "}
